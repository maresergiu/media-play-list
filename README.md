## How to install the project

In order to install the app you have to run `npm i` twice:

1. run `npm i` in the root directory
1. run `npm i` in the /api directory

After both folders have their node_modules in the project root directory run `npm run start-app`.
This command will start the app and the website API in the same time.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start-app`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

- opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- init the website API [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
